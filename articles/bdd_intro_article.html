<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) is a Test-Driven Development
	(TDD) at the product level. In software development, a product
	development starts with a set of product requirements and product
	specifications. A computer application is a software product that an
	end-user (a person) and/or another computer application can interact
	with so that some type of benefit can be realized.</p>

<p>When a segment of the product requirements in a form of a user
	story is reasonably defined and accompanied with a set of specific
	acceptance criteria, a software development team can start developing
	software for that user story. The product owner - the one who writes
	the user story (i.e., requirement) uses the acceptance criteria to
	accept or reject the software that implements the user story.</p>

<p>In order to clarify further the criteria he would use to accept
	the story, the product owner provides a set of specific examples (use
	cases) through an collaborative session with a developer and a tester.
	The 3 amigos (product owner, developer and tester) explore, discover
	and defines specific examples that helps 'drive' the development of the
	user story.</p>

<p>The output of the 3-amigos collaboration session should yields a
	number of specific examples or scenarios that will be made executable.
	A scenario specifies a behavior of the application in a ubiquitous
	language (i.e., English, French, Spanish, etc.) that consists of
	non-technical, shared vocabularies the three amigos and other
	stakeholders can understand. Gherkin is such language.</p>

<p>Gherkin, the language, consists of a small set of 'keywords' that
	can be used to formulate a specific behavior of an application. The
	keywords are:</p>
<ol>
	<li><strong>Given</strong></li>
	<li><strong>When</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Then</strong></li>
	<li><strong>And</strong></li>
	<li><strong>But</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Let's consider this example about using access card to enter a building.</p>

<code>
<font color="red">Given</font> I have an access card to the company	headquarters building<br>
<font color="red">And</font> I am in the front of the building<br>
<font color="red">When</font> I insert my access card into the card reader<br>
<font color="red">Then</font> the door should open<br>
<font color="red">And</font> I can enter the building<br>
</code>

<p>Another example:</p>

<code>
<font color="red">Given</font> I have $5 in my checking account<br>
<font color="red">When</font> I deposit $10<br>
<font color="red">Then</font> I should have $15 in my balance.<br>
</code>

<p>The above example is testable specification and it can be refined further
	if necessary during and/or after the collaborative exploration & discovery
	session (aka. 3-amigo). However, it is important that this specification
	remains true during the life of the application. They becomes the living 
	documentation of the application after they</p>

</p>

<p>After the 3-amigos session, the developer should have sufficient
	information and data to start design and develop the user story.
	Ideally, the 3-amigos session should convene only when the developer
	is ready to work on the story. This just-in-time approach is important
	because the emphasis is on the conversation between the three important
	groups of people. Otherwise, valuable information discovered during the
	session would be lost.</p>

<p>Together with the developer and UX/UI person(s), the tester should 
	design and develop necessary test steps to automate the examples developed
	during the 3-amigos session. </p>
	
<code>
<font color="red">Given</font> I have $5 in my checking account<br>
	I set up an account with a balance is $5<br>
	I insert my ATM card<br>
	I enter my pin <br>
<font color="red">When</font> I deposit $10<br>
	I select deposit cash option<br>
	I insert my $10 cash into the deposit slot<br>
	I confirm the deposit amount<br>
<font color="red">Then</font> I should have $15 in my balance.<br>
	I check my balance<br>
	My account's balance should be $15<br>
</code>

<p>At this point, both the programmer and tester are ready to begin their work
	together in a form of pair-programming. It is believed that programming 
	together in pair yields
	higher quality of the code. The programmer develop the code and the tester
	validate the code using the Gherkin (Give-When-Then or GWT) specification 
	language</p>
	
<h2>Automating validation without changing specification</h2>

<p>In an Agile development process, an iteration is often short (less than one month). 
	Therefore, validating all the specifications manually is a near impossible task
	even for a mid-size application. Therefore, it is necessary to automate as many of 
	these specifications as possible in order to ensure the quality of the work.</p>
	
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
	
<p>Dan North defines BDD as an 'outside-in' approach in that he means to start with 
	the needs of the user through a well-written user story with a good set of acceptance
	criteria). Define the specifications for a story interactively and collaboratively.
	By focusing on the needs of the user, it is likely that the application will
	meet them.</p>

<p>North also insists on a 'pull-based' system in that begin the collaborative and interactive
	work on a user story on when the development team is ready to work on it.
	This just-in-time approach is important because in BDD face-to-face conversation
	is utmost important. The impact of a conversation reduces over time.</p>

<p>BDD requires 'multiple-stakeholder' in that the product owner, the developer 
	and the tester to work together
	closely in the very beginning of and throughout the development of the user story.
	Many trivialize the power of the customer (i.e., product owner) on site and
	the need of the team working together in the same location. Any arrangement
	other than that can only be up to the 'next' best thing.</p>
	
<p>BDD works with the development of a user story (25% of an iteration) or
	an epic (many iterations for a release). Multiple development teams 
	can develop specifications in the same manner for a large user story (epic).</p>
	
<p>Last but not least, automating the validation of these specification will enable
	an Agile team moves at a much faster speed with safety (protected by the
	automated tests).</p>
	


<p>BDD is thought to be the second-wave of the agile software development approach.
	BDD enables the software development team to build the 'right' application.
	It encourages the product owner to be up front and transparent in what the
	product must do (behave) and how the product specification is being validated
	when it completes.</p>
